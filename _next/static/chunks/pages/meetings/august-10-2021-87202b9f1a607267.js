If any one has more up to date information, please share.\n\n    I am unfortunately short on time, so I will already provide my vote for agenda point 2)\nI would wholeheartedly like to vote in favour of buying the mining equipment for the price shown in the message above:hand:.\n\n* __defistaker__ : I am voting in favour too\n\n* __anynomous__ : Regarding making an official plan for the community mining, I think we do not have a full plan yet, here are some suggestions:\n    - Pay electricity prices on a quarterly basis using a month average in Grin to the community miners.\n    - Regarding the G1 location, I might be able to get a place in Belgium with electricity prices of 8-10 cents. They offer for 8 for larger scale, but they might be so kind to offer it for our single unit as a way of sponsoring, still need to contact them.\n\n* __future3000__ : That sounds good re elec cost. Imo we really need to bring the cost down close to 10 cents/kw to stay competitive in the future. \n\n* __anynomous__ : I think I can offer to provide exposure to their sponsoring, so that maybe others might use their location for mining equipment in exchange for making an exception of accepting a single miner.\n\n    Would that be acceptable for everyone, to make such an offer, a bit similar to how NHash supporst/sponsors the community?\n\n    Please indicate with thumbs up or down.\n\n    ( __cekickafa__, __defistaker__ ,  __anynomous__,  __dtavarez__,  __future3000__,  __dtavarez__ responded with thumb up)\n\n* __anynomous__ : Thx\n\n* __anynomous__ : Of course, if there are alternative locations with good electricity price, we should consider those as well. But in case there are no good alternatives, I  think it is a solid plan.\n\n* __anynomous__ : I have to go now, I will read up later on any suggestions for setting up the mining, maybe @ __future3000__ can go over points discussed on the forum, so we can already discuss how to take the points given into account. Just a suggestion though, feel free to shape the discussion differently :smile:\n\n* __dtaverez__ : \n    >Pay electricity prices on a quarterly basis using a month average in Grin to the community miners\n    \n    what would it be the simplest way to do this? can we pay using grin? \n\n* __anynomous__ : Each miner can withdraw it himsel, but we do need to account this publicly.\n\n* __future3000__ : Yeah should definitely be paid in Grin. \n\n* __dtavarez__ : I think we said that we will withdraw everything to the CC public Grin wallet, right?\n\n* __future3000__ : Could be based on a 30day moving average of Grin/usd \n\n    (__cekickafa__,  __defistaker__,  __dtavarez__ thumb up)\n\n* __dtavarez__ : makes sense to me\n\n* __future3000__ :\n    \n    - CC miners must confirm their avg electric $ per kw- Which they will be paid a USD equivalent of Grin in each month\n    \n    - CC miners must send all their Grin rewards to a public Grin wallet. \n    \n    - At end of each month CC miners are paid their total electric cost for the month from the public Grin wallet, based on a 30-day moving average of GRIN/USD. \n\n    (__defistaker__,  __dtavarez__,  __cekickafa__ thumb up)\n\n* __cekickafa__ : yes,there wont be much friction imo. nice plan:+1:\n\n* __future3000__ : we also need to confirm who from CC will be allocated the G1s and how many units they will be allocated( 12x G1 mini & 1 x G1). We also need to factor in additional shipping costs( since the price quoted from Nhash is only to Germany). \n\n    Further more;  for the G1, we really need to find somewhere to host it with reasonable elec costs( circa 10c/kw). \n    As pointed out on the forums: \"Most of the CC are based in Europe where electricity can be upwards of 0.35 \\$/kWh, where in the US 0.12 can be fairly common.\n\n    - 2800w @ 0.35 \\$/kWh is going to cost \\$8590 per year\n    - 2800w @ 0.12 \\$/kWh is going to cost \\$2945 per year\n\n* __dtavarez__ : now I think, the identities should remain private, we don't know the future repercussions. \nbecause all the madness around crypto lately \n\n* __future3000__ : That is a good point.  We still need to confirm this internally though. \n\n* __dtavarez__ : yes.\n\n* __future3000__ : Then we can explain the allocation publicly- eg 12x G1 mini's are being allocated to 4x CC members.\n\n* __defistaker__ : __anynomous__ mentioned, he is looking into a place in belgium with 0.10 cents power cost\n\n* __future3000__ : Yes, this sounds ideal.\nI can currently get good electric rates, $0.10/kw. But I don\u2019t want to put my hand up for it, because I can\u2019t guarantee how long I can get those rates for.   \n\n* __defistaker__ : \n\n    - CC miners must confirm their avg electric $ per kw- Which they will be paid a USD equivalent of Grin in each month\n\n    - CC miners must send all their Grin rewards to a public Grin wallet. \n    \n    - At end of each month CC miners are paid their total electric cost for the month from the public Grin wallet, based on a 30-day moving average of GRIN/USD. \n\n     - __anynomous__ will get in contact in a datacenter with 8-10 cents power cost for G1 in exchange for exposure for them so that other miners can use their facilities.\n\n    - Identities that running mining equipment will not be disclosed in public for privacy concerns ( this will be discussed internally in council)\n\n* __defistaker__ : This is the summary of today's meeting notes/decisions.\n\n* __dtavarez__ :  the energy cost for G1 mini miners will be paid in grin based on a 30day moving average of Grin/usd\n\n__Meeting adjourned__                    \n                    \n                    "})]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"py-4",children:[(0,t.jsx)("h1",{className:"header-2",children:"Action Points"}),(0,t.jsx)("ul",{className:"space-y-2",children:(0,t.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,t.jsx)(a.Z,{})," ",(0,t.jsx)("b",{children:"anynomous"})," will get in contact in a datacenter with 8-10 cents power cost for G1 in exchange for exposure for them so that other miners can use their facilities.."]})})]})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[608,774,888,179],(function(){return n=1233,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
