They indicate the CC and OC need for a tool to verify how many keys are used to sign a MultiSig transaction as security proof. The script we developed provides this security proof by including additional transaction signatures in a text file which combined with the online transaction is used by the script to verify which keys were used to sign.\n\n  The tools works, tested by Anynomous and John Tromp and other CC members, published: (https://github.com/grincc/security) Anyone can test and run the code to find proof the CC has had recent access to all 6 keys. Later the tool will be improved so the OC and CC can provide proof of which keys were used over multiple transactions.\n\n  So, yesterday I had contact with both John and Joltz, they are both fine with the security proof since it is now public and verifiable by anyone.\nJohn already contacted the OC last week, and according to Joltz they will proceed this week with the payment to the CC. So with a bit of luck we have access to our funding this week.\n\n* __mcmmike__ : from my understanding all technical requirements are now fulfilled?\n\n* __anynomous__ : They are, and it now has been confirmed by both John and Joltz.\n\n* __mcmmike__ : ok good, any question/suggestions from anyone about this topic?\n\n* __anynomous__ : The delay in funding unfortunately resulted in us losing out on our chance to buy a G1 miner, but more about that in the next agenda topic.                    \n                    \n            "}),(0,s.jsx)("h1",{id:"issue_3",className:"text-xl mt-10 mb-4 px",children:"3.
