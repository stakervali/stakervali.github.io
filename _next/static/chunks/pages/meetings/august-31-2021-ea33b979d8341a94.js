OpenRPC is language agnostic. I just felt it was more formal and would make reviewing the API easier for the other developers.\n\n* __phyro__: I see, my assumption was based on their generator. Though the last time I checked it was over a year ago and it had support for generating clients from the spec for rust and typescript\n\n* __scilio__: We don't have to even use OpenRPC, but by defining the schema this way, any developer can implement the APIs unambiguously. You may be correct. I haven't looked for generators yet.\n\n* __anynomous__: Did you already look into the different options?

My only reason for delaying the decision is I want to spend some time with the build configurations for each to see which will require the least amount of maintenance in the future.\n\n* __future3000__: Do you have much experience using Rust or C++?\n\n* __scilio__: I have the most experience with java, but I'm not going to reinvent the wheel by rewriting the major grin data structures and cryptography in java. Of the 3 being discussed, Rust is the only one I've never used in production code before.\n\n* __vegycslol__: Personally I'm cheering for rust or go (or haskell :D)\n\n* __scilio__: C++ has the most mature crypto libraries. Rust is quickly catching up. Go is great for services.

So a vote may not even be necessary at this point. I'm more or less just looking for a commitment to the project, and to make sure there is nobody against the idea or terms laid out.\n\n* __future3000__: I assume we are voting now on milestone 1 and will vote again for milestone 2 & 3?\n\n* __mcmmike__: good question, how do you think we should do it?\n\n* __future3000__: Well logically we should vote to approve payment after each milestone is met.\n\n* __phyro__: I agree. The review we make of the milestone is sort of the vote for the payout as well\n\n* __kurt2__: I am personally voting against. I have nothing against Scilio and I am willing to change my mind if he is willing to accept payment after something that is actually a coinswap demo project at the minimum. I have not yet understood why the first milestone is an indicator of the subsequent skills needed to make the project . it seems the price for the first milestone is inflated. it would be probably fine for someone with a reputation but I don't think it is for someone with no reputation like scilio. by respect too for the previous contributors whose most of them used euros by the way and not pounds. I don't think monero for example would be willing to fund the current request of scilio in their funding process. Plus with the new funding of the two community administrators I am sure we will find contributors willing to show track records to implement coinswap very quickly!\n\n* __phyro__:\n     > __kurt2__:\n     \"Plus with the new funding of the two community administrators I am sure we will find contributors willing to show track records to implement coinswap very quickly!\"\n\n    I'm not sure how this one follows. I don't expect any new candidates writing the coinswap because we hired 2 administrators. Also, implementing a minimum demo isn't really a small task imo @__scilio__ do you plan on being more active here as you are building this?\n\n* __kurt2:__ \n    > __scilio__: \"Also, implementing a minimum demo isn't really a small task imo @__scilio__ do you plan on being more active here as you are building this?\"\n\n    It is not. that's the cost you pay if you don't want to deanonymze yourself. we should build a good reputation. the risk is huge and totally unnecessary to take given we have community administrators that will help to find people for such project very quickly. the risk is too big and not reasonable in this context. Monero would not go forward with such a funding request.\n    and they would be right.\n\n* __cekickafa__: \n    >  __kurt2__ : \"... and they would be right\"\n\n    monero give all funds to 1 person without multisig. i dont think so man, they are a measure\n\n* __scilio__: I designed the 3 milestones to be an equivalent amount of work. So by that measure, the price for the first milestone would be deflated. I did this on purpose to strike a balance between receiving funding needed to dedicate my time to this on the one hand, and earning the trust of the community on the other. If you feel milestone 1 is less work, I think you may be overlooking important parts of it. That's my fault for not listing all of the minute details. One major part of it that is easy to overlook is that the encryption and decryption algorithms must be supported in order to implement the API validation. That's a major chunk of work.\n\n * __jankie1800__: We could headunt devs but imo the ones who find us, who see value in the project are the ones who should be prioritized during hiring. my 2 grins\n \n* __mcmmike__: I am currently not sure how we should proceed with this item on the agenda, as this discussion is going into a direction I did not expect.\n\n* __kurt2__: I think funding request of first milestones should not be inflated by unknown contributors. that is probably one of the basics to put in place. especially when the skills to make the first milestone do not echo at all the skills to make the further milestone. \n\n* __defistaker__: Is it an option to unify 1st and 2nd milestones so that there are only 2 milestones and payments are done with equal amounts 25000.\n\n* __scilio__: You are asking me to work for 4 months without payment. This is not an option for me unfortunately.\n\n* __kurt2__: unknown contributor = anonymous with no proven track records and 0 reputation in the community (!= anonymous)\n\n* __phyro__: we made such decisions before though, Gene was the same\n\n* __anynomous__: It is not ideal I agree. I would have preferred milestone 1 and 2 to be merged. But if we are to inflexible, I do think we make it that much harder to find developers. Since I do not see anyone else having volunteered to take this on.... beggars can't be choosers. The only risk we have is overpaying for milestone 1 since it value decrease somewhat if scilio would not be able to finish milestone 2 or 3.\n\n* __scilio__: I'm asking for post payment for this very reason. If it is required for someone to work full-time for 4 months before being eligible for funding, then you will likely struggle to find dedicated developers.\n\n* __future3000__:\n    > __kurt2:__ it is not. that's the cost you pay if you don't want to deanonymze yourself. we should build a good reputation. the risk is huge and totally unnecessary to take given we have community administrators that will help to find people for such project very quickly. the risk is too big and not reasonable in this context.\n\n    \n\n* __anynomous__: To me, although not ideal, it is acceptable.\n\n* __phyro__: \n    > __anynomous__ :\"Since I do not see anyone else having volunteered to take this on.... beggars can't be choosers. The only risk we have\" \n\n    It doesn't decrease. Even after all his milestones, there's an additional milestone which is making the existing wallets implement 1-1 self-spends, label these outputs and take care of this logic in the wallet.\n\n* __scilio__: Hopefully I can help with those milestones too, when the time comes :)\n\n* __phyro__: which is also why I'm cheering for Rust, because he'll need 1-1 self-spend for tests. So they may come for free for grin-wallet\n\n* __future3000__: \n    > __mcmmike__ : \"I am currently not sure how we should proceed with this item on the agenda, as this discussion is going into a direction I did not expect.\" \n    We keep discussing, then we vote. Today. \n- \ud83d\udc4d _mcmmike\n\n* __anynomous__: Agreed, today As I stated before, although I agree with @kurt2 that we take a risk which is not ideal, this risk is acceptable. The other side of the coin is dropping the proposal, which to me, would provide a bigger risk, the risk of having the whole implementation delayed for indefinite time, which is much worse.\n\n* __future3000__: Grin also needs transaction in terms of new development. CoinSwap is the hottest proposal we've got atm.  I think most of the community would be disappointed if we didn't move forward with @__scilio 's__ request.\n\n* __anynomous__:Ok, if no one objects, we continue with a vote.\nAll in favour, say yaaaa, thumbs up, party, rocket or otherwise express your excitement.\nAll against, thumbs down.\n- \ud83d\udc4d _mcmmike, _anynomous, _future3000, _hendi, _johndavies24, _defistaker, _cekickafa\n\n* __anynomous__: Then it is settled.
