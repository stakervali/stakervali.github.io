Doing this would serve as community building and keep strong the shaking cup side hand. Already this post has garnered financial support from inside the community so it may well serve as a case-study of reaching to outside established channels for support.

It might even be, that the need and opportunity do not arrive, if the miners produce enough in time... What are your opinions on it?\n\n* __dtavarez__ : my personal opinion is that, yes, we want to have enough coins, but I don't see the pressure to have them asap\n\n* __anynomous__ : My opinion is similar, I think yes we should allocate the funds, but no need to rush into anything, it just means we can if it is needed.\n\n* __defistaker__ : I am for the keep it simple approach.

Review of Scilio's coinswap milestone 1 & discuss approval for milestone 2 start "}),(0,s.jsx)(a.Z,{className:"meeting-text",remarkPlugins:[r.Z],children:" \ngithub PR : https://github.com/mimblewimble/mwixnet/pull/1 \n\nforum discussion : https://forum.grin.mw/t/request-for-funding-scilio-coinswap-implementation/9149/55\n\n\n* __anynomous__ : is the reviewing of the coinswap already done, or in a far advanced enough state to approve milestone #1? \n    * __yeastplume__ : A few of us reviewed it, we're happy with progress so far and happy to have Scilio contributing\n\n* __dtavarez__ : Joltz has made a comment after review found [here](https://github.com/mimblewimble/mwixnet/pull/1#pullrequestreview-813030113)\n> * __joltz__ (from github comment) : \"This PR seems to implement the basics as described in the first milestone. Beyond that, I don't have much to add that hasn't already been brought up in these comments.I do have some comments about the specification itself but will keep them in the forum thread. It's nice to have you here Scilio, looking forward to seeing your next work.\n\n* __anynomous__ : So that is a yes? \n    * __phyro__ : Yes, as yeastplume mentioned, we are happy and we merged the milestone #1. Could someone remind me which council was supposed to cover the coinswap?\n\n* __jankie1800__ : I recall Scilio requested funding came through the GrinCC.\n * __anynomous__ : Indeed he did. So the Grin CC has to make the transfer, we can all sign it so we can use it as our second quarter security proof.\n * __phyro__ : Ok, great :grin: \n\n* __future3000__ : CC picked it up because we wanted some action\n * __yeastplume__ : I don't think it was clear from the funding requests who was to fund it (core fund has no problem funding quality work either, it just needs to be clear from the outset)\n * __anynomous__ :  think we can always later on discuss distributing funds in case the Grin CC runs out, for now that is not an issue.\nThe funding is not separate based on programming language, there are just different emphasis on what kind of projects to fund from the Grin OC and Grin CC.There most certainly will be overlap, we all work towards the same goals. The requests was made in general, the Grin CC honored/approved it, so I think this one we can fund from the Grin CC funds.\n\n* __yeastplume__ : I think we may have to work this out a bit; we could have a case where the community funds somthing that needs core devs to review/merge, but if it's not up to snuff (according to OC) and we can't merge it we might have contention.In this case scilio's work is of good quality, so we're fine. But that won't always be the case. I just don't want a situation where OC starts being accused of being elitist or playing political games because a piece of work isn't of sufficient quality, or there isn't sufficient consensus to merge it.\n * __anynomous__ : I think we can always cross that bridge when we get there. I think in general as long as we all discuss things with respect for each-other, differences in opinion are never an issue, they are just part of a healthy eco-system with healthy discussions, which might indeed include disagreeing sometimes. Correct me if am wrong, but all these things are just procedural. Both councils have formal meetings, discuss things and vote on them. There might be times that the OC approves something (for funding or committing), that the CC has doubts about and vise versa. But that is not different from the situation with one council. In the end, the community decides (assuming there is proper argumentation).\n\n* __phyro__ : It could still be an issue if the OC wants to invest time elsewhere and doesn't agree we have time to review a certain project. \n * __anynomous__ : It is true, the CC is very much dependent on good reviewers, for which many are part of the OC. We cannot change that. But in this case I think it is about how to view these community members. I think we should see them all as community members, volunteers, no one is paid for reviewing. So there can be no contention, or blame if someone does not volunteer to work or review anything. For this reason I also do not foresee contention between OC and CC, since we simply ask community members, not members of the council. So lets make clear that we separate the role of OC and CC members which are just formal bodies to make decisions, and any activity that members of these governing bodies do as community member.\n\n* __mcmmike__ : I think what __@yeastplume__ wanted to highlight, if there is something the OC is not agreeing on because of bad programming or possible future problems, they can still decline the PR into rust wallet.\n\n* __anynomous__ : Regarding governance and overlap, possible contention between OC and CC, maybe we should simply have chat about that sometimes, preferably over a beer. I do not think the CC will have any wrong expectations or demand from OC members, we are all volunteer after all. Alternatively we could maybe discuss it one time in a joint OC CC meeting, I mean why not have such a meeting.\n \n* __anynomous__ : Unless there is anything else we should discuss, I would like to wrap up the meeting for today and thank you all for attending. \nLets press onwards:muscle:, many interesting developments with Grin lately:grin:\n\n__Meeting adjourned__\n                \n"})]}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"py-4",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{className:"header-2",children:"Action Points"}),(0,s.jsxs)("ul",{className:"space-y-2",children:[(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Follow up thank you to those in the community who made monetary donations today in addition to the ongoing contributions of time and energy"]}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Discuss potential meeting time between OC and CC"]}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Follow up with hotbit exchange for update and provide additional support."]}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Review THORchain protocol and revisit at a later date"]}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Follow up to refresh security proof and update transaction log"]}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.Z,{}),"Community donation campaign possible ideas and solutions for future funding models"]})]})]})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[608,774,888,179],(function(){return n=902,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
